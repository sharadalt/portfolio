Analetrics provides the solution for you with good set of features. Once you register your applications with Analetrics you can track the events to the registered application.

Once you are registered, with your name, you can register the applications to be tracked. Analetrics provides wiki CRUD operations as well. 

Analetrics is built in Ruby on Rails framework with MVC architecture. It uses html, CSS and bootstrap-sass to stylize. It uses ruby gems to achieve some of it's tasks. It uses postgreSQL for it's database needs.
