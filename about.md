I am the first engineer in a family of doctors, bankers and administrative professionals. While in elementary school, I dreamt of becoming a lawyer. While in high school, I wanted to become a scientist. My dad wanted my brother to become an engineer. My brother chose a different profession, then my dad wanted me to become an engineer.</p> <p>Since I had not firmly decided whether to become a lawyer or a scientist and I was not averse to becoming 
an engineer, I became an engineer. I like being an engineer.

I started my career in telecom embedded field. I have written software for both voice and data communication. 
I was thrilled, the first time, when the code I had written was put in the network and people started making 
voice call using my software. I have also written software for TCP/IP applications, APIs, device driver software. 
In addition to development, I have done system integration, system test, automation and sustain engineering jobs.

After playing all the software roles in telecom field, I felt I need to get into a field which makes me feel more creative
and passionate about my job. That is when I decided to get into web technologies. I took training in this to be able to do I want to do. I am excited for having made my portfolio public. Though it might seem like a small thing, for me it is a milestone. After I started doing projects in this area, I felt the need to know Data analytics, So I 
got a certification in Data base and Data Analytics.  Now I feel I am equipped enough to explore this arena. I love
what I am doing now.

Web technologies is vast, there is lot to learn. I like to try out new stuff. When I am not doing that, I like teaching kids. I have learned Indian classical music and Indian classical dance for few years. I experiment with cooking.
I read books if I hear good reviews and when I am in mood. The rest of the time, my daughter who is in middle school takes 
away my time. I love to take long walks. Otherwise, I spend time in web browsing and reading magazines and exercising.
