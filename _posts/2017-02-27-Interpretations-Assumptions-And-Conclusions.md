---

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Why are the interpretations interpreted the way they are interpreted? Have you analyzed them anytime? It is very interesting when you actually sit and analyze them. 
<p>
There is nothing like an absolute interpretation. The interpretation is based on our conditioning  which is itself a product of our past experience, expectations, back ground, value system, the people around us in a given situation, physical location  and so many other factors.
</p>
<p>
We will be very confident of our interpretation. Our assumptions will be based on our interpretations and we trust our assumptions dearly and come to conclusion. Not only that we will goto any extent to defend our conclusion. We form strong opinions about people based on our assumptions.
</p>
<p>
I will now  share  the way I interpreted some incidents that occurred  in my life and the assumptions/conclusions I arrived at.  Then how I learned some lessons later. Some of you might relate to people like me, some of you might consider them strange and some of you might even consider them as idiotic or funny. But remember you have to deal with such people in life and we live in civilized world :-)
</p>
<p>
 I am sure most of you would empathise with me.
</p>

<h3>Situational Interpretation</h3>
<p>
 Long back, When I went to a Chinese restaurant with some of my friends, an interesting thing happened. We had our food and the waitress brought us the cheque. Ofcourse the fortune cookies came along. 
 
 <p>As usual, everyone started opening the cookie and reading it and talking about the lucky numbers, bla, bla,... I opened mine with curiosity, alas! There was no note in the cookie! It was  so unexpected! It was one of those days, where since morning not very good things were happening to me and added to that no fortune note in my cookie.
 </p>
 <p>
I was thinking, atleast I could have gotten some nice note in the cookie to cheer me up. I was deprived of that too. According to me all terrible things were happening to me. I was feeling kind of uneasy. My feeling was very much connected with the situation I was in that day.
</p>
<p>
All my friends observed my uneasiness and may be wondering why I gave  such importance to such a small matter. 
Then one of them, gave me an encouraging statement saying, you don't need a fortune cookie to tell you your fortune. You make your fortune yourself. Instantaneously my spirits improved. 
</p>
<p>
It  was not that  my other friends were feeling sorry for me and happy for themselves. It is just that, at that instant they didn't know how to react. As far as the cookie note, I started thinking, the cook who was filling the cookies might have just forgotten to put the note in my cookie or might be having some fun or the notes got over just for that cookie and the cook felt lazy to fill the box from another place. Anything could have happened right? My wisdom told me later, Absence of fortune note in a fortune cookie is not something to be taken seriously and feel miserable because of that.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, As a side effect, After that incident, It was cemented in my mind that I am the one who can define my fortune. What's your interpretation  and conclution of absence of a note in the fortune cookie? :-) 
</p>

<h3>Interpretation based on wrong assumption</h3>
<p>
I was again in a similar kind of situation. This time what happened is, I was taking a Facilitation workshop.
</p>
<p>
I was a member of toastmasters for few months. Because of which my public speaking skills are not bad. 
</p>

<p>
Facilitation is not same as public speaking. In public speaking most of the time, it is one way talking and the audience will mostly be listening to you. You just focus on what you want to convey and answer their questions. In the facilitation workshop we were taught how to conduct or facilitate a meeting along with a co-facilitator where  you share your time with your co-facilitator. Additionally, you need to involve the audience. It is both way communication most of the time. 
</p>

<p>
As a part of the workshop, we had a practice session. There were lot of experienced facilitators who were giving quite good feed back on every budding facilitator mentioning what was good or bad. The practice facilitation team included, facilitator, co-facilitator, a scribe and a time keeper. 
</p>

<p>
When my turn came  I was a bit anxious as I was doing it for the first time. of course  I made sure I did not show my anxiety. First as a rule, I was supposed to ask the team members one by one to introduce themselves to the audience  which, I promptly did. But  I missed the time-keeper who was not in the immediate vicinity. Someone reminded me, It made me more anxious. But outside very confidently with smiling face I called out Ms.Time keeper can you introduce yourself. We completed the facilitation.
</p> 

<p>I was not happy with my performance as I had goofed up right in the beginning. That was my conclusion. how ever I waited  for the feedback. Guess what? bummer! I did not get any feedback. My co-facilitator got some feedback for improvement. I felt bad. My assumption of absence of feedback meant I did very bad. To my surprise, when I spoke to couple of participating members, One of them said I did pretty good with my smiling face and confidence while  the other one said, she was assigned with some responsibility and did not focus much on my facilitation. But she thought it was ok. many others also said it was ok.
</p>

So I learned my assumption/conclusion based on my interpretation was again  not correct. Atleast some of them did feel I did good and some  were pre occupied with their own assignments. May be people who were supposed to give me feedback felt I did not need any feedback as I showed confidence  and they had given the feed back to my  co-facilitator.  My wisdom told me, as long as I learned something from the workshop don't try to interpret too much , think too much and assume a lot. What do you think? :-)
</p>

<h3>Assumption based on your experience</h3>
<p>
It's very interesting. Read on ... I always assumed  that everyone takes bath/shower the same way I do. That is, before your body wash you wash your hair and tie it up so that it helps your body wash later. That is how  all of us were taught from our mother when we were children. It has always  been hair wash first.  
</p>
<p>One day I was talking to an Indian friend of mine. She is also from southern India like me. Interestingly, she told me that, she and all the people from her place wash their body before they wash their hair. Recently, I read a What'sApp message which said, while having shower, it is good for health, to wet our legs first then the whole body and at the end the head/hair. And here I was thinking that all people wash their hair first and body later. 
</p>

<p>
The lesson learned, I found the other way of having bath interesting and realised  may be other people will find my way to be interesting! Which way do you shower? Do you feel it makes a difference?
</p>

<h3>Location based assumption</h3>
<p>
One of the many good things  that has happened to me since I started living in America is smiling at and greeting everyone including strangers I come across. One day, I attended a meeting where I did not know most  of the fellow participants. I greeted my neighbour. That person after staring at me, just turned the other side without saying a word. It was new to me! I was embarrassed!
</p>
<p>
Later my wisdom told me, may be she is new to this greeting culture or may be she was not in mood or may be she snubbed me. So what? The meeting was in America and there were so many other participants. As a matter fact, I did make many friends in that meeting and the meeting was a success for me.
</p>
<p>
Later during my conversation with the same person, I realized that it was she who was embarassed as she was not used to such greetings in her culture. If I had continued with  my embarassment  what would have happenned?
</p>
<p>
Have you come across such people? How did you deal with them? :-)
</p>

<h3>Interpretation/assumption based on what works for us</h3>
<p>
Finally, let me tell you a classical story related with interpretation and assumption and conclusion.
There were two women, one a florist and the  a fisher woman. Both of them were good friends, selling fish and flowers in a market place. The market place was nearer to the florist's home. 
</p><p>
One day after they completed their business they head towards their homes. It started raining suddenly. The florist invited the fisher woman  to spend the night at her place and fisher woman  agreed. The florist was happy and prepared special food for her friend. She  also filled her friend's room with fragrance of the flowers by spreading the flowers on the floor. The florist went to her room convinced that her friend would have a nice sleep that night. She also thought that atleast today her dear friend would  be away from the nasty fish smell.
</p>
<p>
Fisher woman tries to sleep. But she couldn't. Strange you think? The fact was, she was not used to the fragrance while sleeping. She was accustomed to  smell of fish. After struggling for sometime, she got an idea. She took her fish basket and kept her head near the basket such that, she could get her familiar smell and slept. She was in deep sleep within no time.
</p>
<p>
Next Morning  both women got up feeling happy. Florist enquired if her friend  slept well and she was replied she had great sleep. The florist concluded it was because of her flowers. The fisher woman thought god! What she would have done without her sleep saver fish basket.
</p><p>
How did you like the story? What works for us, may not work for others right? Even if it is very obvious to us, it may not even be an option to others.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Look at the cartoon above. Here both are correct with respect to their locations is n't it?

<p>
Because of the incidents that occurred in my life, I learned  that I need to be very cautious while  making interpretations, assumptions and conclusions. My interpretations, assumptions and conclusions are a result of my state of mind, my way of deciphering the circumstances, my value system etc. which may not always be right or correct. 
</p>

<p>
I need to be open to others' views and interpretations. The situations could be with family, friends or colleagues. With spouse I can avoid lot of clashes and misunderstandings  if only, I do not stick to my interpretations and assumptions and make conclusions. Even at work place if we are open to others views and opinions it would become a better place for all. Ultimately if all of us understand and become open to all the others, the society, which we are all a part of, will also be a better place to live. What is your perspective on this?
