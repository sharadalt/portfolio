I am an Indian American. I am the first engineer in a family of doctors, bankers and administrative professionals. While in elementary school, I dreamt of becoming a lawyer. While in high school, I wanted to become a scientist. My dad wanted my brother to become an engineer. My brother chose different profession, then my dad wanted me to become an engineer. Since I had not firmly decided whether to become a lawyer or a scientist and I was not averse to becoming an engineer, I became an engineer.

I started my career in telecom embedded field. I have written software for both voice and data communication. I was thrilled, the first time, when the code I had written was put in the network and people started making voice call using my software. I have also written TCP/IP, API, device driver software. In addition to development, I have done system integration, system test, automation and sustain engineering jobs.

Of late, I have gotten into web technologies,  Ruby on Rails, LAMP, javaScript, Hadoop Big data, Apache Scala, MySQL, Internet of Things and machine learning. I have been taking training , courses and doing projects in these areas. I love this field. I feel this field is very creative and gives me satisfaction of achievement.

I like teaching kids. I have learned Indian classical music and Indian classical dance for few years. I experiment with cooking. I read books if I hear good reviews and in mood. The rest of the time, my daughter who is in middle school takes away my time. Otherwise, I spend time in web browsing and reading magazines and exercising.
