##### Explanation
Most of living beings, humans, animals and plants love music. Music heals our heart and brain. Love for music is Universal. There is too much variety in music. Variety comes from different cultures. Within the same culture there are lot of variations of music. This all has resulted in infinite amount of music. As the evolution in music is happening, the music storage is evolving so also music playing. Now there are web music players, like spotify.

##### Problem
We want to have the features of legacy music player for playing the songs from the cloud/internet storage. We should be able to play the music on desktop/laptop/ipad/mobile phone. 

##### Solution

BlocJams provides the solution. It's like spotify. Using blocjams, we can select an album from a collection of albums, select a song from the album to play, pause it, start from any point and change its volume. Run all the songs sequentially.

Now let us see how we can play music from blocjams, Start the application, you will see the following page and click on collection.

<div class="boxed" style="width: 100%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid blue;text-align: center;">
    <img src="/img/blocjams_main.PNG"/>
</div>
<br />

It opens up the collection available:

<div class="boxed" style="width: 100%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid blue;text-align: center;">
    <img src="/img/blocjams_1.PNG"/>
</div>
<br />

Now pick up your album and play the song.

<div class="boxed" style="width: 100%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid blue;text-align: center;">
    <img src="/img/blocjams_2.PNG"/>
</div>
