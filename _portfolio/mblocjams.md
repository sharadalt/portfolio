##### Explanation
Most of living beings, humans, animals and plants love music. Music heals our heart and brain. Love for music is Universal. There is too much variety in music. Variety comes from different cultures. Within the same culture there are lot of variations of music. This all has resulted in infinite music. As the evolution in music is happening, the music storage is evolving so also music playing. Now there are web music players, like spotify. bloc_jams is similar to spotify.

##### Problem
We want to have the features of legacy music player for playing the songs from the cloud/internet storage. We should be able to play on desktop/laptop/ipad/mobile phone. 

##### Solution
